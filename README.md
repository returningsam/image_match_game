# Image Match Game
In this simple game, a list of words are displayed, along with an image. The object is to guess which word was used as the keyword in the search that found the image. The answer is often quite surprising, as some images are found with keywords that are seemingly unrelated.

## How it works
- When the game starts, 5 random words are generated using the [Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/).
- The words are then used as keywords to search for images on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
- One of the images is chosen and shown to the user.
